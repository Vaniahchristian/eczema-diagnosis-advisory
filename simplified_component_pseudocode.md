# Simplified Component Design Pseudocode

## 1. Image Capture Component

```python
class ImageCapture:
    def capture_image(self, image_file):
        """Handle image upload and validation"""
        # Validate format (JPEG, PNG)
        # Check file size
        # Store image
        return image_metadata

class ImageProcessor:
    def preprocess_image(self, image_data):
        """Prepare image for ML model"""
        # Resize to 224x224
        # Normalize pixels
        # Check quality
        return processed_image
```

## 2. Diagnosis Component

```python
class DiagnosisGenerator:
    def generate_diagnosis(self, processed_image):
        """Generate eczema diagnosis"""
        # Make prediction using ML model
        # Determine severity
        # Calculate confidence score
        # Identify affected areas
        # Generate treatment recommendations
        return diagnosis_result
```

## 3. Advisory Component

```python
class AdvisorySystem:
    def generate_advisory(self, diagnosis_result, patient_history):
        """Generate personalized advisory"""
        # Get care instructions
        # Identify triggers
        # Suggest lifestyle changes
        # Create treatment plan
        return advisory_info
```

## 4. Analytics Component

```python
class AnalyticsEngine:
    def generate_analytics(self, time_period):
        """Generate analytics reports"""
        # Analyze demographics
        # Calculate geographical distribution
        # Evaluate treatment effectiveness
        # Generate trends
        return analytics_report
```

## 5. Appointment Management Component

```python
class AppointmentManager:
    def schedule_appointment(self, patient_id, doctor_id, details):
        """Schedule new appointment"""
        # Check availability
        # Create appointment
        # Send notifications
        return appointment_confirmation
```

## 6. Security Component

```python
class SecurityManager:
    def authenticate_user(self, credentials):
        """Handle user authentication"""
        # Validate credentials
        # Generate tokens
        # Log authentication
        return auth_tokens

    def authorize_action(self, user_id, action):
        """Check authorization"""
        # Verify permissions
        # Log access
        return is_authorized
```

Each component includes:
- Basic input validation
- Core functionality
- Error handling
- Integration points with other components

The components work together to:
1. Process uploaded images
2. Generate eczema diagnoses
3. Provide treatment recommendations
4. Track analytics
5. Manage appointments
6. Ensure system security
